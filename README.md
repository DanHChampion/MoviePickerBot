# MoviePickerBot 
A Movie "recommender" using [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.dev/) 2.0. This project is to demostrate my learning journey with Angular, focusing on building a multi-page application with state management, routing, and reactive forms. I hosted this project on GitHub Pages as a demo but feel free to bookmark to use it for yourself!
